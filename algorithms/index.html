	<h1>Computer Science = Data Structures + Algorithms</h1>
	<p>Each section will involve standard descriptions and applications. Each section will have multiple applications as well as some standard interview questions. The point of these mini series is to revisit your standard algorithms with their encomposing data structure to quickly prep for a Technical Interview at top Tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft</p>

	<h2>Topics:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="graphs.html">Graphs:</a><p>Standard data structure representation, along with common traversals algorithms are visited. Such as but are not limitied to Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Topological Sort, Cycle Detection, Directed vs Undirected Graphs, Adjacency Matrix vs Adjacency List.</p></li>
